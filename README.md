# AubyTube

This is an AltTube site based on late 2014 YouTube.
You are free to use the source code however you wish as long as you don't host this publicly and create a hellscape of OYC dumbasses.

# Hosting
Download a PHP 8 server, I recommend XAMPP, drop the source code into the htdocs folder, and boot up the server. Go to localhost and it should work. If it doesn't, it's most likely something unrelated to AubyTube fucking it up.
